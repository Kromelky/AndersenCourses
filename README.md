# About myself

## General

My name is Artem. I am 31 years old. I lived and grew up in Rostov-on-don. I'm married. I graduated from the Don State
Technical University in 2012 with a degree in Information Systems and Technologies.

### Course Expectations

 1) Get some expirience in permanently deployments by doing homeworks. 
 2) Implement getting expirience at the enterprise
 3) I hope this expirience help me in future job search
````

## Working Experience

### 2011 - 2012

Combined part-time work and university studies

### 2012 - 2018

Worked as a fullstack java developer on projects for the Ministry of Defense. During this time, he worked his way up to
the first qualification programmer engineer by terms of company grade. Sadly for me responsibility stack became looks
like more as progect management rather than programmer. Permanent business trips and zero professional growth forced me
to take a desigion to change department. I chose administration direction, as it was always easy for me to configure
servers and devices.

### 2018 - ttd

Started as an engineer in infrastructure department. Year and a half ago was promoted to team lead of administrators. Me
and my team working on server cluster health support, networking, development and support of production support systems.

## Soft skills

I suppose my strongest part is to find common ground with team and customers. I am fond of work and could overwork for
about 4 or 6 hours, good that ive got a wife who remind me to go home.
